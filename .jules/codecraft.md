## 2025-12-31 - Refactoring "Code Golf" Anti-Pattern
**Mode:** Razor
**Learning:** The codebase contained significant "code golf" patterns (nested ternaries, short-circuit execution for control flow) which hindered readability. Refactoring these to standard `if` statements and logical blocks improved maintainability without changing logic.
**Action:** When encountering obfuscated Javascript in this repo, prioritize readability refactors (Razor mode) to normalize the coding style.
